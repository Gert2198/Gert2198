## Now
I am currently taking the Fullstackopen course of the University of Helsinky, where I'm learning React best practices and the most up-to-date techniques.

## About me
- I’m currently focused on C++ for game tech (OpenGL + Dear ImGui) and networking (WinSock2, Boost.Asio).
- I'm also working on web development and cloud computing. 
- I love building things from scratch to understand how they work underneath.
- Outside coding, I play the guitar and tinker with music tech.

## Highlight projects
- 🔷 [PruebaOpenGL](https://github.com/Gert2198/PruebaOpenGL) — my micro game engine built in C++ with OpenGL and Dear ImGui.  
  Goal: learn engine fundamentals by implementing rendering, input, and core systems myself.
- ☕ [Cafe Amores](https://github.com/Gert2198/Cafe-Amores) — my first “real and useful” website, made with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 💣 [Buscaminas](https://github.com/Gert2198/Buscaminas) — a Minesweeper clone I built and tweaked for fun; made in Java and Swing
- 🟡 [4enRaya](https://github.com/Gert2198/4enRaya) — Connect Four, but with a tiny twist; also made with Java and Swing. 
- ✊ [Online-RPS](https://github.com/Gert2198/Online-RPS) — online Rock‑Paper‑Scissors; experiments with networking and async server communication, and planning to make a GUI for it.

> If you’re curious about any of these, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion!

## What I’m learning
- Modern C++ patterns and clean engine architecture
- Graphics fundamentals (pipelines, buffers, shaders)
- Multiplatform networked systems with Boost.Asio
- React updated practices

## Big idea on my roadmap
🎼 Audio‑to‑Sheet: a tool that converts a full MP3 into music notation so anyone can play any song they like.  
📝 NT-Notes: a mega note‑taking app that implements every feature of the current best note‑taking apps (Metamoji Note, GoodNotes, etc.).

Notes for future me:
- Add screenshots/GIFs of PruebaOpenGL and games.
- Consider a short “Now” section or a monthly changelog.
- Pin the top 6 repos on the profile for visibility.
