# Hi, I'm Sergio Lozano (Gert2198) 👋

4th‑year double‑degree student in Mathematics + Computer Science.  
Hard‑working, enthusiastic about software development (especially videogame logic), and always learning.

## About me
- I’m currently focused on C++ for game tech (OpenGL + Dear ImGui) and networking (WinSock2, Boost.Asio).
- I love building things from scratch to understand how they work underneath.
- Outside coding, I play the guitar and tinker with music tech.

## Highlight projects
- 🔷 [PruebaOpenGL](https://github.com/Gert2198/PruebaOpenGL) — my micro game engine built in C++ with OpenGL and Dear ImGui.  
  Goal: learn engine fundamentals by implementing rendering, input, and core systems myself.
- ☕ [Cafe Amores](https://github.com/Gert2198/Cafe-Amores) — my first “real and useful” website; the project that got me into shipping for users.
- 💣 [Buscaminas](https://github.com/Gert2198/Buscaminas) — a Minesweeper clone I built and tweaked for fun.
- 🟡 [4enRaya](https://github.com/Gert2198/4enRaya) — Connect Four implementation; great playground for game logic and AI heuristics.
- ✊ [Online-RPS](https://github.com/Gert2198/Online-RPS) — online Rock‑Paper‑Scissors; experiments with networking and latency handling.

> If you’re curious about any of these, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion!

## What I’m learning
- Modern C++ patterns and clean engine architecture
- Graphics fundamentals (pipelines, buffers, shaders)
- Networked systems with Boost.Asio and WinSock2
- Game loops, timing, and input systems
- Profiling, debugging, and small‑scale engine tooling

## Big idea on my roadmap
🎼 Audio‑to‑Sheet: a tool that converts a full MP3 into music notation so anyone can play any song they like.  
I’m exploring DSP + signal processing + ML approaches to make this useful and accessible.
